# Project under Shane Davis Inc.
The project was to develop a scalable file processing API that would allow healthcare companies to send the PDF documents to be processed. 
Our system would process it, send it to be printed and shipped, and send the healthcare company a successful response upon finishing. 
The system was developed in Azure, using tools such as API Management, Function Apps, Virtual Machine Scale Set, Azure Storage, and Networking. 
The project had to be secure as the documents contained sensitive medical information, so everything was designed with security first.

# My Role
Out of a team of 2 members, I was primarily responsible for designing and implementing all the Azure services to be connected to our software.
