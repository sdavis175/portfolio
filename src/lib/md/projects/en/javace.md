# Graduate Level Natural Language Processing Class Final Project

JaVaCE is a 2-part program I designed to help me with learning Japanese, one half is a Vocabulary Recognizer that highlights my known vocabulary in text, and the other half is a Comprehension Estimator that tries to predict my comprehension level of a sentence on a scale of Easy, Medium, and Hard.
The input is a clipboard hook and the output is in the console that highlights the known words and will display the predicted comprehension level using an AI that I designed and trained. 
More detailed explanations can be found in the associated [paper](https://github.com/sdavis175/JaVaCE/blob/main/JaVaCe%20Report.pdf).
