# Project under Shane Davis Inc.

The goal of the project was to take a medical PDF document and convert it to an accessible format for the visually impaired. 
This involved tasks such as using Natural Language Processing techniques to separate out paragraphs and using advanced table processing algorithms. 
The program was developed in a scalable fashion as there is various types of medical documents, and an individual converter had to be developed for each one to ensure correctness. 
Due to the nature of the type of documents, the contents had to be rigorously validated to ensure following proper American ADA guidelines, while maintaining HIPAA approved security.
The project is used only inside the company, it is not meant for public use. 

# My Role
