I own my own company, Shane Davis Inc., which was contracted to US Braille. 
For that job, I would develop PDF processing tools to take medical documents and process them into an accessible format using Python so that the vision-impaired can read their medical documents. 
I also built and managed a large-scale file processing API that was built in Azure.
