Built for a CS Professor at University of Central Florida (UCF) as a final Senior Design project. 
The intended goal was to create a web application that students can submit their program and associated test cases for an assignment and the web application would process the test cases on the students programs and verify it produced the correct output by comparing to the professor's provided code. 
If the student was able to create a test case that broke other student's programs, they would receive a point on a leaderboard associated with the assignment. 
This is intended to gamify test case creation and submissions as students would compete to create extreme test cases so that they can get more points. 
The result of this is to push students to create more robust programs so that their programs will not crash on the test cases.
Our sponsor of the project was happy with the final product.

# My role
I was the project manager and lead backend developer, with some small help in assisting the front-end development as well. I lead a group of 4 other programmers to develop this project, using project management tools such as Gantt charts to help with organization.
For backend development, I created the majority of APIs used with Django for the front-end to request and send data to our database. I also developed the robust system for running the student's programs, which was done in a multithreaded solution using Docker containers to safely encapsulate the student's code so that no malicious code could affect the web application or other student's code.

JaVaCE is a 2-part program I designed to help me with learning Japanese, one half is a Vocabulary Recognizer that highlights my known vocabulary in text, and the other half is a Comprehension Estimator that tries to predict my comprehension level of a sentence on a scale of Easy, Medium, and Hard.
The input is a clipboard hook and the output is in the console that highlights the known words and will display the predicted comprehension level using an AI that created. 
More detailed explanations along with the ablation results can be found in the associated [paper](https://github.com/sdavis175/JaVaCE/blob/main/JaVaCe%20Report.pdf).

## Known Vocabulary Source
For both tools, a known word database is required for the tools to be customized to the user. 
The database can be generated from two sources, an import from Anki (which is a SRS Flashcard tool that many Japanese learners use to memorize vocabulary) and a manual word input. 
The data is then loaded into their dictionary form (inflections removed) using the SudachiPy library to perform the tokenization and conversion.

## Vocabulary Recognizer
The design uses a simple maximization algorithm to match the longest sequence of known vocabulary tokens to the longest sequence in the input sentence. 
The input sentence is first tokenized using the SudachiPy tokenizer to split the sentence into tokens and convert them into dictionary form, so that each token can directly match with the original stored known vocabulary version of it. 
There are various additional parameters such as automatically recognizing all Katakana loan words, English words, and grammar particles; adding the Kanji readings; and generating an array of known vs unknown tokens (which will be used in the Comprehension Estimator).

## Comprehension Estimator
The comprehension model is trained using a pre-trained BERT language model (specifically, [bert-base-japanese-v2](https://huggingface.co/tohoku-nlp/bert-base-japanese-v2)) via the transfer-learning method for tokenizing the input along with a custom embedding to mark if each token is a known word using the previous Vocabulary Recognizer component.
A classification network is then attached to that output as a classifier to determine the level of comprehension a user will have in a sentence.
The model is trained on a dataset of hand-labeled sentences that is classified as Easy, Medium, and Hard comprehension levels based on the user's understanding. Also, I developed an additional side program to help users with generating this dataset by displaying a sentence and asking for the comprehension grading, and if that sentence has an associated English translation than the user can verify their comprehension levels.`,g=""+new URL("../assets/output.72880418.png",import.meta.url).href,b=""+new URL("../assets/training-stats.39687704.png",import.meta.url).href,f=""+new URL("../assets/confusion-matrix.9bd2e9d2.png",import.meta.url).href,w="",y=""+new URL("../assets/example.7bb27ef4.png",import.meta.url).href,k=""+new URL("../assets/example2.81e65db5.png",import.meta.url).href,v=""+new URL("../assets/original-method-failure.f5b0a512.png",import.meta.url).href,D=""+new URL("../assets/model-diagram.f9c8f45a.png",import.meta.url).href,x=[{slug:"senior-design-project",color:"gold",description:o,shortDescription:"Gamifying program and test case submissions for students in Computer Science",links:[],logo:e.UCF,name:"UCF CS Testing App",period:{from:new Date("2021-08-04"),to:new Date("2022-05-01")},skills:t("en",["python","js","docker","django","dynamodb","reactjs"]),type:"Web Application",screenshots:[{label:"Login Page",src:s},{label:"Home Page",src:c},{label:"Assignments Page",src:d},{label:"Test Case Modal",src:p},{label:"Leaderboard Page",src:m},{label:"Grading Page",src:h}]},{slug:"javace",color:"red",description:u,shortDescription:"Japanese Vocabulary and Comprehension Estimator",links:[{to:"https://github.com/sdavis175/JaVaCE/",label:"GitHub"}],logo:e.Nihongo,name:"JaVaCE",period:{from:new Date("2023-02-01"),to:new Date("2023-05-02")},skills:t("en",["python","pytorch","sklearn","numpy","keras"]),type:"Language Learning Program",screenshots:[{label:"Output",src:g},{label:"Training Statistics",src:b},{label:"Confusion Matrix",src:f}]},{slug:"dreambooth-multi-subject",color:"blue",description:w,shortDescription:"Fine trains a text-to-image diffusion model on multiple subjects based on the existing Dreambooth method",links:[{to:"https://github.com/sdavis175/diffusers_dreambooth_multi_subject",label:"GitHub"}],logo:e.Unknown,name:"DreamBooth Multi-Subject Diffusion Model",period:{from:new Date("2023-03-02"),to:new Date("2023-05-01")},skills:t("en",["python","pytorch","numpy"]),type:"Text-to-Image Diffusion Model",screenshots:[{label:"Example Output 1",src:y},{label:"Example Output 2",src:k},{label:"Original DreamBooth method failure point",src:v},{label:"Model Diagram",src:D}]},{slug:"league-cs-helper",color:"red",description:o,shortDescription:"Object recognition and analysis for the video game League of Legends.",links:[],logo:e.Unknown,name:"League CS Helper",period:{from:new Date("2023-02-01"),to:new Date("2023-05-02")},skills:t("en",["python","pytorch","sklearn","numpy","keras"]),type:"Language Learning Program",screenshots:[{label:"Login Page",src:s}]}],j=[{slug:"senior-design-project",color:"gold",description:l,shortDescription:"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
